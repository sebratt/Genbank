## Objective: 
To parse, munge, transform two large tables for the purpose of disambiguating authors in Scientometric Metadata:

There are millions of authors and inventors who submit references to NCBI’s GenBank. The problem of author and inventor name disambiguation such as in USPTO and PubMed has been extensively researched. Researchers used manual methods, as well CV-matching as an approach to disambiguation, but linking multiple representations of the same entity while preserving the fidelity of the referent (that is, linking all alternate spellings individual names “without incorrectly linking similar names referring to distinct entities”  (CITE https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201764). [@sebratt](https://github.com/sebratt) wrote this paragraph apparently.
